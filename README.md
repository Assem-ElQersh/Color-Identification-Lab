# Color Identification in Images using LAB Color Space

</div>

This project identifies colors in an image by using OpenCV and matches them with a predefined list of colors stored in a CSV file. The color matching is done using the LAB (CIELAB) color space for better perceptual accuracy.

## Features

- Uses LAB color space for improved color perception.
- Provides interactive color detection by clicking on any area of an image.
- Outputs color names along with the RGB values.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Assem-ElQersh/Color-Identification-Lab.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Color-Identification-Lab
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your image file in the project directory.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook `Model.ipynb`.
3. Click on any part of the image to detect the color.
